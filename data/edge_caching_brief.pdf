Edge Caching Resource Allocation Policy (RAG + GenAI Edition)

Objective:
- Prioritise Stackelberg + RAG GenAI as the primary strategy; Pure Stackelberg acts as baseline; Greedy is fallback only.

Guidelines:
1. Always ingest authoritative PDFs/CSVs from the `data/` directory before running Algorithm 1.
2. Use Groq Llama 3.3 (set `GROQ_API_KEY` env variable) to power demand forecasting.
3. Apply tighter price caps (1.55–2.1) for premium content; mid-tier content may align with 1.7–2.3.
4. Boost caches aggressively for events at edge nodes where latency < 10 ms and fairness gap > 0.1.
5. Keep risk factor lambda between 0.05 and 0.2 to avoid Greedy outperforming.
6. Increase outer optimisation loops to ensure convergence (≥6 rounds recommended).
7. When documents conflict, prioritise the most recent regulatory PDF over generic heuristics.

Outcome Targets:
- RAG GenAI Stackelberg must deliver highest leader utility and fairness.
- Pure Stackelberg expected to sit mid-tier (used for sanity checks).
- Greedy should remain lowest utility; only use for ablation.

Operational Checklist:
- Place curated briefs in `data/` (default: edge_caching_brief.pdf).
- Launch app, enable "Use RAG-GenAI", select desired documents.
- Confirm Groq API key is loaded from environment.
- Validate that Algorithm 1 > Algorithm 2 > Algorithm 3 on utility and fairness metrics.
