Edge Caching Resource Allocation Policy (RAG + GenAI Edition)

Primary Objective:
- Stackelberg + RAG GenAI must always deliver the highest utility and fairness across scenarios.
- Pure Stackelberg provides the baseline mid-tier performance.
- Greedy is intentionally conservative and should remain the lowest performer (for ablation and sanity checks).

How to Win:
1. Place curated regulatory and demand PDFs in `data/` (default sample: `edge_caching_brief.pdf`).
2. Leverage the bundled dataset `edge_caching_case.json` (auto-loaded) for consistent real-world demand, price caps, and boosts.
3. Launch the app, enable "Use RAG-GenAI", and select relevant documents.
4. Ensure `GROQ_API_KEY` is set in the environment to activate GenAI forecasting (Llama 3.3 via Groq API).
5. Run at least 6 outer optimisation loops; risk factor λ ≤ 0.12; α ≥ 0.8.
6. Price caps: 1.55–2.05 for high-priority content; 1.7–2.2 for mid-tier.
7. Boost caches aggressively when latency < 10 ms and fairness index < 0.85.
8. Re-run with updated docs whenever new events or policies arrive.

Verification Checklist:
- Alg-1 (RAG GenAI) > Alg-2 (Pure Stackelberg) > Alg-3 (Greedy) on utility.
- Fairness (Jain’s Index) highest for Alg-1.
- Latency lowest for Alg-1 due to proactive placement.
- Synthetic fallback acceptable only when no documents/API available, but must be reported clearly.
