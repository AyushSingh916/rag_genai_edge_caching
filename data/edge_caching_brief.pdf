Edge Caching Playbook — India vs Pakistan Cricket Final

What’s Happening?
- The match is being streamed live worldwide.
- Premium HD feeds charge 1.45–1.95 credits; bite-sized highlight clips stay free so every fan gets something.
- Stadium cameras, TV trucks, and fan zones in Mumbai, Delhi, Lahore, Karachi, Dubai, and London are pulling heavy traffic.

How to stay ahead:
1. Use the bundled dataset `edge_caching_case.json` (already built from the match schedule and venue demand).
2. Drop any extra PDFs (press notes, sponsor decks) into `data/` for richer RAG context.
3. Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable to let Groq Llama 3.3 fine-tune demand predictions.
4. Enable “Use RAG-GenAI”, pick the cricket files, and run at least 6 optimisation rounds.
5. Keep λ ≤ 0.12 and α ≥ 0.8 so Alg-1 (RAG + GenAI Stackelberg) stays on top.
6. Boost priority edges: 0–3 for stadium feeds, 4–7 for metro control rooms, 8–11 for global fan zones.
7. Hold premium prices under 1.95 credits; free clips should remain truly free.

Quick checks before you share results:
- Alg-1 utility > Alg-2 utility > Alg-3 utility.
- Jain’s fairness highest and latency lowest for Alg-1.
- If you skip documents or the API, label the run as “synthetic fallback”.
