Edge Caching Resource Allocation Policy

Key Points:
- Prioritize AI-assisted demand forecasting using RAG and GenAI.
- Apply tighter price caps (1.6-2.2) for critical content.
- Increase cache boosts for events at edge nodes with latency < 10ms.
- Use conservative risk factor lambda <= 0.2 to avoid under-utilization.
- Preferred strategies: adaptive pricing, fairness balancing, latency-aware placement.
