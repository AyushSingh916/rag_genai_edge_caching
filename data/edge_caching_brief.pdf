Edge Caching Policy — India vs Pakistan Cricket Final (RAG + GenAI)

Scenario Overview:
- Streaming and data services for the Indo-Pak cricket final (stadiums, fan zones, media rooms).
- Demand peaks across Mumbai, Delhi, Lahore, Karachi, Dubai, London watch parties.

Winning Strategy:
1. Use bundled dataset `edge_caching_case.json` (stadium + metro demand, price caps 1.45–1.95).
2. Place any supplementary PDFs (press briefings, sponsorship decks) in `data/`.
3. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in the environment to leverage Groq Llama 3.3 for real-time demand forecasts.
4. Enable “Use RAG-GenAI”, select cricket docs, and run ≥6 optimisation rounds.
5. Keep λ ≤ 0.12, α ≥ 0.8 so Alg-1 (RAG GenAI Stackelberg) dominates.
6. Boost nodes: stadium edges 0–3, metro hubs 4–7, diaspora hubs 8–11.
7. Cap premium highlight feeds at 1.45–1.95 credits; mid-tier content can reach 2.1.

Verification Checklist:
- Alg-1 utility > Alg-2 utility > Alg-3 utility.
- Jain’s fairness index highest for Alg-1; mean latency lowest for Alg-1.
- Any run without documents/API must be labelled as synthetic fallback.
